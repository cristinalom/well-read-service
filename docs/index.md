## Get started

> Have you [installed the Well-Read Service and established an authenticated connection](placeholder.md) in your development system? Make sure you have all the requirements in your system before you begin.

Let's start with a quick tutorial on getting a book recommendation based on a specific reader persona. Make sure that the **Well-Read** Service in your system has at least one [`book`](../api/book.md) resource and one [`persona`](../api/persona.md) resource in its database before you start this tutorial.

Getting a book recommendation in the service requires that you use the `GET` method to retrieve the details of a [`persona`](placeholder.md) resource in the service.

**To get a book recommendation by persona:**

1. Start the service by using this command in your command-line tool.

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/to-do-service/api
    json-server -w to-do-db-source.json
    ```

2. Open the Postman app on your desktop.
3. In the Postman app, create a new request with these values:
    * **METHOD**: POST
    * **URL**: `{{base_url}}/users`
    * **Headers**:
        * `Content-Type: application/json`
    * **Request body**:
        You can change the values of each property as you'd like.

        ```js
        {
            "last_name": "Jones",
            "first_name": "Jenny",
            "email": "jen.jones@example.com"
        }
        ```

4. In the Postman app, choose **Send** to make the request.
5. The response body should look something like this. Note that the names should be the same as you used in your **Request body** and the response should include the new user's `id`.

    ```js
    {
        "last_name": "Jones",
        "first_name": "Jenny",
        "email": "jen.jones@example.com",
        "id": 5
    }
    ```
